# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the Lee DevKit tool by adding a command to push CocoaPods libraries to spec repositories. The command will encapsulate the `pod repo push` functionality with configurable spec repositories and podspec files, making it easier for developers to update their CocoaPods libraries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an iOS developer, I want to push my CocoaPods library to a spec repository, so that I can share my updated library with my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the command with a podspec file THEN the system SHALL push the podspec to the configured spec repository
2. WHEN the user specifies a spec repository THEN the system SHALL use that repository instead of the default one
3. WHEN the user does not specify a spec repository THEN the system SHALL use the default repository from configuration
4. WHEN the command is executed THEN the system SHALL include standard flags like `--allow-warnings`, `--verbose`, `--skip-import-validation`, `--use-libraries`, and `--use-modular-headers` by default

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an iOS developer, I want to configure multiple spec repositories, so that I can push to different repositories for different projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user configures spec repositories THEN the system SHALL store them in the user configuration file
2. WHEN the user adds a new spec repository THEN the system SHALL validate the repository URL
3. WHEN the user lists spec repositories THEN the system SHALL display all configured repositories with their names and URLs
4. WHEN the user sets a default spec repository THEN the system SHALL use it for all push operations unless overridden

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an iOS developer, I want to customize the push command options, so that I can adapt to different project requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user wants to disable certain default flags THEN the system SHALL provide options to disable them
2. WHEN the user wants to add additional flags THEN the system SHALL allow passing extra arguments to the underlying command
3. WHEN the command is executed THEN the system SHALL display the actual command being run for transparency
4. WHEN the command succeeds or fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about the operation result

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an iOS developer, I want to automatically detect the podspec file in the current directory, so that I don't have to specify it every time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no podspec file is specified THEN the system SHALL look for a .podspec file in the current directory
2. WHEN multiple podspec files exist in the current directory THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to select one
3. WHEN no podspec files are found THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
4. WHEN a podspec file is found automatically THEN the system SHALL confirm which file is being used
